# SimpleChargeAlarm
A app that gives a notification to the user when battery level is over 80% and the phone is charging. It uses foreground service to give the notification so the user will be notified even s/he closes the app. The app is made only for my personal learning purposes, so unfortunately it's not very well commented.
